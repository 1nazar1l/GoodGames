                    "Chernarus – The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post-soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand-crafted environment based on real life locations.",
                    "Livonia – The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier-than-ever world.",
                    "Meet Others",
                    "Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.",

                    "The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.",

                    "Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.",

                    "Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.",

                    "Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse.",

                    "Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school 1990s PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment. CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences.",
                    "Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very, very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging experience that doesn't have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice."

For example if you were to talk to a NPC that made your character angry, that would then give you the brawler class. With the brawler class you'll mainly be using physical abilities and less of the focus bases abilities. Each class also has it's own drawback as well. Going back to the brawler class, it's main drawback is that you're more susceptible to focus based attacks, on the plus side for this class you would receive a power increase to deal more damage to kind of balance things out."

Merciless aggression is the key; with defeating enemies being the only way to restore precious health, or, in Mokou's case, pain tolerance. Inspired by a deep love for both the Touhou Project and games like Hollow Knight and DOOM, Fujiwara Phoenix is a relentless, fast-paced platformer that pushes the boundaries of the metroidvania genre.",

Make your way through different screens in each stage, fighting a variety of enemies and collecting various pickups like coins and ability-modifying equipment items. While there is a healthy amount of backtracking and secret stuff to find, Fujiwara Phoenix places a strong focus on combat with our DOOM and ULTRAKILL inspired health/mana system.",

Mokou is totally invincible, but that doesn't mean she can't feel pain. She uses this to her advantage with reckless fire magic that she can heal any burns from, but beware her limited pain tolerance. Once it runs out, she will pass out from exhaustion and you'll be sent back to a checkpoint.",

                    "这里我们并非说其他所谓的美国内战题材游戏都不好玩，我们承认其中一些还是不错的，但与《美利坚英雄传说：第二次革命战争》相比，那些游戏更像是小品，它们的深度和层次显然无法与这个作品相提并论。",
                    "想象一下，你正在阅读一本史诗般的著作，被其中丰富的人物、曲折的情节和宏大的历史背景深深吸引，而《第二次革命战争》就是这样一个游戏，它以史诗般的故事和细腻的剧情为骨架，以历史人物为血肉，将玩家完全带入到那个时代，感受到历史的沉重与伟大。",
                    "在《第二次革命战争》中，你不仅仅是作为一个观察者，更是作为一个参与者，深入到历史事件的核心地带。你会遇到历史上的真实人物，与他们交流、互动，甚至可能改变他们的命运。你会亲身体验到历史的风云变幻，感受到那些重大历史事件带来的冲击与影响。",
                    "《第二次革命战争》比其他电影、游戏的时间跨度更广。其他作品无一例外都从1861年开始，这就像讲三国从220年开始一样，因为他们只关注战场和射击。这样的选择忽略了之前的重要历史事件和人物，比如约翰·布朗和其他了不起的废奴主义者，正是这些英雄造就了第二次革命和第二次革命战争这段历史。",
                    "《第二次革命战争》关注的正是这段历史真正的主人公和英雄们，他们的故事甚至不是从1854年堪萨斯武装斗争开始的，也不是从1831年废奴运动崛起开始的，而是追溯到了十八世纪的第一次革命的种子。",
                    "同时，故事不只是聚焦某个人或事件，而是通过细腻的情节展现了整个历史的风貌，事无巨细地呈现了那个时代的社会、政治、文化和经济状况。反观其他作品，即使它们提到了1861年之前的历史，也再一次无一例外都是流水账，尤其是那种让虚构的主角客串到每一个重要历史事件走走过场的做法，不仅缺乏历史真实性，而且让那些故事看起来幼稚可笑。毕竟，真实的才是有力的。",
                    "最后，其他作品无一例外总是倾向于忽略约翰·布朗这样的英雄，如果无法忽略就加以贬低抹黑，甚至公然赞美奴隶主，它们在道德水平和历史洞察力上都远远落后于这个时代，甚至远远落后于当年的废奴的亲历者的时代。《第二次革命战争》则更加注重揭示历史的真相，力求呈现出更加完整和真实的历史。",
                    "总的来说，《美利坚英雄传说：第二次革命战争》以史诗般的故事和细腻的剧情为载体，将玩家完全带入到历史的长河中，在深度、丰富性上都表现得更加出色。如果你想要在游戏中体验历史的波澜壮阔、人物的悲欢离合、情感上的满足以及精神层次的升华，那么这个游戏绝对是你的不二之选！",

                    "Brief Description",
                    "The tactical war game is a strategic game with a classic perspective system and an enhanced artistic style, featuring an exciting story about a war between two forces, both human, but one group comes from a parallel planet to Earth after the destruction of their planet, seeking a new home. They face resistance from the indigenous inhabitants who consider it an alien invasion. To excel in the game, you must create a tactical battle plan. Based on that plan, you must balance between defense, offense, and resource acquisition.",
                    "Game Factions",
                    "The game currently consists of two main factions: the Terrans, the army of native citizens on Earth fighting against the space invasion, and the Assarlions, humans who came from a planet similar to Earth from a distant place. Each faction in the game has different and unique elements with varying combat abilities and styles, including tanks, combat vehicles, various types of aircraft, soldiers, and robots.",

                    "The base construction system employs a 'blueprint' approach, allowing players to concentrate on developing both colony defenses and the army simultaneously, eliminating the need to wait for units to be ready as seen in classic construction games. Construction is designed to be not only easy but also customizable, enabling players to create the desired base design effortlessly, all while ensuring a secure defense.",

Players draw specific paths, set objectives, and determine battle routes based on events that unfold in the game. Assigning tasks to each element is crucial to ensure the success of the plans. Building an army depends on the pre-prepared plan, requiring the player to ensure a suitable tactical approach to the war by choosing the appropriate elements to execute the plan and anticipating everything that should be present at all times.",
                    "Resources:",
                    "Money in the game is essential for victory, so players need to build their plans based on sufficient cash flow. The lack of funds leads to a halt in progress in the war. The game includes several systems for obtaining money, and players must choose the most suitable method for investing funds, either by increasing the economy through available methods, building defenses to fortify economic structures, or constructing an army to attack the enemy.",

At the beginning of the test, we repeatedly polished, scrutinized, and quarreled about some unreasonable interface design, and also faced player experience problems caused by various server client crashes, and we also encountered a lot of setbacks, but the reason why we persevered was because the team were loyal players of SLG, and after watching all kinds of brain-opening excellent works on the market, some of them brought us new thinking and inspiration, but some did not really meet everyone's expectations for SLG games, and we have been thinking. What exactly do you expect from a truly fun SLG genre game? So we wanted to create a strategy game that went back to square one and dedicated to players who really like SLG and really wanted the real war theme in our hearts. Under comprehensive consideration, we chose the genre of Bandu Like to make everyone relatively familiar and easy to get started, and we added a lot of our own understanding and optimization on the basis of the core gameplay of this category (among which the hero can swallow the card of the same name from low-level to high-level is the highlight of our game design), hoping to get everyone's like.",

But our team strives to give everyone the most authentic medieval period and is committed to restoring the trajectory of the Crusades, so all the original paintings and architectural models are made by looking for a lot of information and strictly checking them. We still need to continue to grow, and I sincerely thank you for your tolerance and understanding! At the same time, I look forward to talking to you to help us make the game better and create a better gaming experience for you.",

However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnès' request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways.

Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department's elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a 'crimson' monster was spotted at the scene of the crime...",

                    "The Republic of Calvard",
                    "A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region's recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.",
                    "Messeldam",
                    "A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oración—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape's architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.",

Basically, it's a love letter from the 90s, the golden era of RPGs.",
